ABSTRACT ARTICLEHISTORY
Tarbinskiellus portentosus (Lichtenstein, 1796) is an agricultural and forestry pest, but people in some Received27July2021
places use it as a delicacy. The complete mitogenome of T. portentosus (GenBank accession number Accepted11January2022
MZ427921) is 15, 498bp in size, including 13 protein-coding genes, 22 transfer RNAs, two ribosomal
RNAs genes, and a noncoding AþT-rich region. The AþT-rich region is located between 12S rRNA KEYWORDS
and tRNAIle. The base composition of the whole T. portentosus mitogenome is 40.62% for A, 9.87% for Mitogenome;Tarbinskiellus
